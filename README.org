* motion-mode-js
A toy project for visualizing "M-mode" ultrasound along arbitrary scan lines chosen in real-time in the browser.

The ultrasound video is taken from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound#/media/File:Ultrasound_of_human_heart_apical_4-cahmber_view.gif][Wikipedia]]. It has a [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/][CC BY-SA 3.0]] license, and this license applies to this project also.

** What is this?
M-mode (motion-mode) ultrasound imaging is when we look at a single scan line and see how it changes over time. The result is an image where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents pixels along the scan line. It let's us see motion in a single still image.

This small project lets us select arbitrary scan lines to create m-mode images from.

The code has been tested and works in Safari 14 and Chrome 89.
